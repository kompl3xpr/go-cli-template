# Internal Packages

## Overview

This directory contains Go packages for internal use. These packages are **restricted to internal use within this project only** and cannot be imported by external projects.

## Usage Guidelines

- These packages can only be imported by other packages within this project
- External projects cannot import these packages (enforced by Go compiler restrictions)
- Suitable for implementation details that should not be exposed externally

## Development Standards

1. Each subpackage should have a clear single responsibility
2. Avoid circular dependencies between internal packages
3. Expose clean interfaces to the outside while hiding implementation details
