## Development Environment Setup

### 0. Prerequisites

#### Tools

Ensure you have `git` (version 2.9 or higher), Go toolchain, `golangci-lint`, and `make` installed.

<details>
<summary>Expand: Tool Installation on Windows</summary>

On Windows, we recommend using chocolatey (a software management solution) for installation. Steps:

1. Right-click the Start menu and open PowerShell or Terminal **as Administrator**.

2. Run the following command to install chocolatey (Warning: command may be outdated, please refer to the [official website](https://chocolatey.org/install)):
    ```shell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```

3. Wait until you see `Chocolatey CLI (choco.exe) is now ready.`

4. Execute the following command (remove parameters for tools you **already** have installed):
    ```shell
    choco install git golang golangci-lint make
    ```

5. Wait until the terminal indicates successful installation.

</details>

#### Initial Git Setup

*Skip this step if already configured.*

<details>
<summary>Expand: Setup Steps</summary>

1. Set username and email

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name YourGitHubUsername
    git config --global user.email YourGitHubEmail
    ```

2. Optional: [Generate SSH key and upload public key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

3. Optional: [Generate GPG signature and upload public key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)

</details>

### 1. Clone your forked project locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/go-cli-template.git
cd go-cli-template
```

### 2. Add upstream remote repository:
```bash
# Execute in project root directory
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kompl3xpr/go-cli-template.git
```

### 3. Git Hooks Setup

**Important: Git Hooks setup is mandatory!**

To ensure code quality, we use Git Hooks to automatically run code checks and tests during commits.
```bash
# Execute in project root directory
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
For Linux/Unix systems, also run the following command to ensure hook scripts have execute permissions:
```bash
# Execute in project root directory
chmod -R +x .githooks/
```

After setup, the following will automatically run on each commit:
- Code style checks, static analysis, compilation attempts, and test execution
- Automatic generation of header comments for source code
- Verification of commit message and branch naming conventions

If hooks fail, please fix the relevant issues before committing.

### 4. Build and test the project
```bash
# Execute in project root directory
make
```
Or equivalently:
```bash
# Execute in project root directory
make clear
make build
make test
```

If build or tests fail, check if your environment configuration is incorrect. If the failure is not due to local configuration issues, please submit a relevant Issue.

## Code Style

Please follow the project's code style conventions:
- Use `make fmt` to format code
- Write clear comments
- Add appropriate test cases

## Commit & Pull Request Conventions

### Commit Message Convention
```bash
# Note the space after the colon
# Commit format can be
git commit -m "type: description"
# or
git commit -m "type(module/subdirectory): description"

# Examples:
git commit -m "feat: add `--reload` command for CLI"
git commit -m "fix(internal/api): status code of GET v1/users"
git commit -m "docs: fix typo in README.md"
```

#### Commit Types

Must be one of: `feat` `fix` `docs` `style` `refactor` `test` `chore` `ci`

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `feat` | **New feature**, involving addition or modification of source code. |
| `fix` | **Bug fix**, involving source code modifications to resolve issues. |
| `docs` | **Documentation updates**, such as README, code comments, etc. |
| `style` | **Code style** adjustments, formatting changes that don't affect code meaning (spaces, indentation). |
| `refactor` | **Code refactoring**, structural code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features. |
| `test` | **Test case** additions or modifications, including unit and integration tests. |
| `chore` | **Build/toolchain** changes, such as dependency updates, Makefile or script modifications. |
| `ci` | **CI configuration** updates, modifying continuous integration processes or scripts (e.g., `.github/workflows`). |

#### Module/Subdirectory

1. Optional but recommended
2. Describes the area/section affected by the commit, e.g., `(cmd)` indicates command-line related changes

#### Commit Description

1. English imperative mood, lowercase first letter, space-separated words, e.g., `remove heading emojis in README.md`
2. Minimum 6 characters, maximum 80 characters

## Branch Naming Convention
```bash
# Use hyphens instead of underscores
# Use forward slash "/" not backslash "\"
git checkout -b type/description

# Examples:
git checkout -b feat/add-reload-command-for-cli
git checkout -b fix/api-get-user-404
git checkout -b docs/readme-typo
```

### Branch Types
See [Commit Types](#commit-types)

### Branch Description
1. English imperative mood, lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only, hyphen-separated words, e.g., `remove-heading-emojis-in-readme`
2. Minimum 6 characters, maximum 80 characters

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your fork is synchronized with the upstream repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Submit clear commit messages
5. Open a Pull Request and describe your changes

Our maintainers will review your PR and may suggest modifications. This is normal in open-source collaboration - don't be discouraged!
